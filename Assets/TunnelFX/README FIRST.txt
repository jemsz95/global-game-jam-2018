How to use this asset
---------------------

Thanks for purchasing Tunnel FX.

Run the demo scene to get a first contact with the asset. It will allow you to change from one preset to another.

To use the asset in your project, select your camera and add "TunnelFX" script to it.
Use the custom inspector to select a preset configuration or customize the effect. Some properties in the inspector shows a tooltip with some additional details.

Remember to remove the Demo folder once you don't need it anymore.


Hints
-----

- Texture alpha channel can be used to create smooth blends
- Performance is scalable - using one layer will be faster than using 4 layers
- Do not enable "Depth Aware" to avoid camera depth texture fetches if you don't need it
- Choosing a preset will revert all values to the factory settings. When you change a value, the preset changes to "Custom". This allows you to preserve your changes in your scene.


C# Scripting support
--------------------

You can access the script API from C#:

using TunnelEffect;

TunnelFX fx = TunnelFX.instance;
fx.preset = TUNNEL_PRESET.xxx;

You can also call PlayTransition mode to issue a quick/flashy screen transition to current values. Useful when setting your own configuration or after loading/enabled the component with your custom settings:
fx.PlayTransition(2.0);
